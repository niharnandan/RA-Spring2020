- optimal strategy.py: this is a code that investigates: 
  1) fixed number of trials, with no cost
  2) with cost each investigation, agents choose to stop
  It prints tables and graphs for optimal investigation, see explanation.

- optimal strategy final.py: this is a code that only investigates with cost each 
  investigation, choose to stop. It plots optimal strategy graph over different cost 
  levels, with parameters for conservative/confirmative/certainty bias

The second piece is a major piece.
